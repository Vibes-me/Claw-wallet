- [x] Transaction history

## 🚧 Phase 2: Production Ready

## 🌐 Phase 4: Distribution
- [ ] Python SDK
- [ ] TypeScript SDK with types
- [ ] LangChain integration
- [ ] OpenClaw skill
- [ ] Self-hosted deployment guide
- [ ] Cloud offering (optional)

## 💰 Monetization
- Transaction fees (0.5% per tx)
- Premium features (multi-chain, webhooks)
- Enterprise (self-hosted support)

## Target Customer
**Humans building AI agents** who need:
1. Agent to hold funds
2. Agent to make payments  
3. Agent to earn money

**NOT other AI agents (yet)**

## Positioning
> "Add a wallet to any agent in 60 seconds. No SDKs, no key management, no contract deployment."

## Account Abstraction Tradeoffs (Current)
- **Latency:** AA adds an additional bundler + entry point path, so end-to-end confirmation is slower than direct EOA sends.
- **Dependency:** AA reliability now depends on external bundler/paymaster availability and policy sync.
- **Chain support:** AA is currently scoped to a subset of chains while provider compatibility matures (`base-sepolia`, `base`, `ethereum-sepolia`, `optimism-sepolia`).
